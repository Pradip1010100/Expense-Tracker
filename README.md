# Expense Tracker

An **Expense Tracker** application designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking income and expenses. This project is developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and SQLite for data storage.

## Features

- Add, view, and delete expense entries
- Track income and expenses with category selection
- Generate summaries for monthly, weekly, or custom date ranges
- Interactive and user-friendly interface with Java Swing
- Persistent data storage using SQLite

## Project Structure

- **ExpenseTracker Folder**
  - Contains all Java files for application logic and UI.
  - `lib` folder containing SQLite JDBC (`sqlite-jdbc-3.47.0.0.jar`) for database connectivity.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java 8 or higher
- **SQLite**: Pre-installed or packaged with the JDBC library
- **SQLite JDBC Library**: The application requires `sqlite-jdbc-3.47.0.0.jar`, located in the `lib` folder.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pradip1010100/Expense-Tracker.git
   ```

2. **Set up the SQLite database**:
   - Ensure the SQLite JDBC library is available by placing `sqlite-jdbc-3.47.0.0.jar` in the `lib` folder.
   - The database file will be created automatically when running the application for the first time.

3. **Compile and run the application**:
- Ensure Java is installed and the `java` command is in your PATH.
- Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   javac -cp .:lib/sqlite-jdbc-3.47.0.0.jar Main.java
   java -cp .:lib/sqlite-jdbc-3.47.0.0.jar Main
   ```

4. **Double-Click to Run (Optional)**:
- Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```bash
     java -jar ExpenseTracker.jar
   ```
- If `.jar` files are associated with Java on your system, you can simply double-click `ExpenseTracker.jar` to start the application.

5. **Launch the application**: You can start adding expenses and tracking your finances.

## Usage

1. **Add Expense**: Enter expense details, such as amount, category, and description.
2. **View Expenses**: Display a list of all expenses with filtering options.
3. **Generate Reports**: View summaries based on selected date ranges or categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: User Interface
- **SQLite**: Database management
- **SQLite JDBC**: JDBC driver for SQLite database

## Future Enhancements

- Data export to CSV format
- Enhanced data visualization with charts and graphs
- Budget and savings tracking
